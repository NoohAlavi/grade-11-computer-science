I first learned how to code from a book that I found at the school book fair in fourth grade,\n    about creating websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From that starting point, I learned more languages and tools, like Python, C++, TypeScript, \n    and a bit of C# and Java. I also made a bunch of web apps, and games using the Godot game engine. I am also learning more about hardware and electronics by using tools like \n    Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I decided to take this course so that I can learn new things and review whatever I already know. I also plan on pursuing a field in computer-related \n    studies in my post-secondary years, which is another reason why I decided to take this course.");
        System.out.println("What do you hope to learn in this course?\n    I hope to learn more about Java and how to use it, and how it compares to other languages that I know.");
        System.out.println("What is your favourite piece of technology?\n    My favourite piece of technology is either my PC or my Oculus Quest 2.");
        System.out.println("What is your favourite app or computer program?\n    The app or computer program that I use the most is either YouTube or Discord.");
        System.out.println("What is one thing that is interesting/funny about yourself?\n    Something interesting about myself is that I have been programming since fourth grade.");
